## 📖 Project Overview
This project is a fully automated workflow that sources, curates, and distributes a hyper-local daily newsletter for Denver, Colorado. Every morning, the system fetches real-time data, uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize the most important stories, and sends a professionally designed HTML email to subscribers.

### **Key Features**
- **Real-Time Sourcing:** Automatically pulls news from `Denverite` and local event calendars via RSS.
- **Live Weather:** Integrates with the `Open-Meteo` API for accurate local forecasts.
- **AI-Powered Curation:** Uses **Groq (Llama 3.3)** to act as an "Editor-in-Chief," writing catchy intros and concise 2-sentence summaries.
- **Responsive Design:** Generates a beautiful, mobile-friendly HTML newsletter template.
- **Zero-Maintenance:** Runs entirely on a schedule (Triggered daily at 7:00 AM).

## 🏗️ Workflow Architecture

The workflow is divided into five logical stages:

1.  **Trigger & Config:** A `Daily Schedule` node starts the process, while a `Configuration` node stores URLs and recipient details.
2.  **Sourcing:** Parallel nodes fetch News (RSS), Events (RSS), and Weather (JSON API).
3.  **Preparation:** Data is cleaned, standardized, and aggregated into a single text block.
4.  **AI Analysis:** The `Groq LLM` processes the data and outputs structured JSON containing summaries and titles.
5.  **Distribution:** The `HTML Generator` creates the visual layout, and the `Gmail` node sends the final email.
